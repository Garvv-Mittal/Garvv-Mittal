💻 About Me

I'm Garv Mittal, an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) undergraduate at Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, driven by a passion for self-improvement, leadership, and building practical, impactful solutions.

As the President of TechShuttle, my college’s tech society, I lead teams, organize events, and turn creative ideas into reality — from designing posters and preparing presentations to hosting live coding competitions and engaging audiences.

I love programming in Python and C, and I’ve built several projects that reflect my curiosity and learning journey:

🐍 Snake Game – my first project, the one that made me fall in love with coding

🕹 Pong Game – a fun and interactive classic recreation

⏱ Pomodoro Timer – boosting productivity through structured focus

🔐 Password Manager – secure and simple tool for everyday use

♠️ Blackjack Game – strengthening logic and modular coding skills

I’m constantly exploring how technology can make life more efficient and creative.
